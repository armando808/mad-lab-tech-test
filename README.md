# MadLab Gutenberg Task

Please fork and clone the repo from GitHub, then open using VSCode or similar, and open the terminal, ready to to run the commands.

The only assumptions I can think that I've made, are that for the first 2 tasks, you want the first page of results (from using the standard request) and then want these manipulated as described in the task.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies, enter the following command into the terminal and hit enter:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. Run the server, enter the following command into the terminal and hit enter:
    ```bash
    node app.js

3. To view the data for all tasks, open your browser and visit this link, then click the various links to view the data for each task (please note, loading times are a little slow, especially the task 4 link, please have patience!):
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/books/tasks-home
